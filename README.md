# Microeconometrics:  Replication Paper

I replicate all 8 Tables in Angrist and Krueger (1991) using STATA and provide a summary and critical review of the aforementioned paper -- Does Compulsory School Attendance Affect Schooling and Earning? --
in the first and second section of the report.

STATA codes and log files could be found under **01_code** folder and **02_logfile** folder.
