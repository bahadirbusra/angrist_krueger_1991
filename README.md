# Microeconometrics:  Replication Paper

I replicate all 8 Tables in Angrist and Krueger (1991) using STATA and provide a summary and critical review of the aforementioned paper - Does Compulsory School Attendance Affect Schooling and Earning? -
in the first and second section of the report in https://github.com/winsup/angrist_krueger_1991/blob/master/01_paper/replicate_paper.pdf.

STATA codes and log files could be found under **01_code** folder and **02_logfile** folder.
